Hi Glenn,

Belated happy new year. So after a long delay (sorry), I have finished
documenting this bootstrap step, and the hope is that with this new
documentation, Masao or any of your future RA can redo the bootstrap
with no need to sorting through previous communications. The
documentation also explains how files in this email thread were
generated. I have put everything in Masao\Dec2017Updates, including
updated versions of the files you have just attached.

In particular,  I have tested the files on department servers and I
think one could even rerun the time-consuming part of the bootstrap
(optimizing the objective function and therefore completely correct
the duplicate indexing issue we discussed) pretty much by just
uploading those files to department servers. So you could ask Masao to
start now if he has one or two hours to set things up and check status
every day. If he won't be available soon, you can hire anyone now or
later. My access to MIT's network will end on Jan 25 so I don't think
I can see a full rerun finished, but before that I can help whoever
working on this make sure things are set up correctly.

Best,
Hongkai
